ApplicationMonitor 0.2 by Alurcard2

This module keeps track of whether or not a certain application is running,
and provides events for when that application starts and ends.


Initalizing an application monitor:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can initalize application monitors either in a RC, 
*ApplicationMonitor (name) (application) [update frequency]
- name: Name which specifies which will identify evars (eg FireFox)
- application: application to monitor (eg firefox.exe)
- update frequency: (optional, default=200) how often, in milliseconds, to
  check the application. min=10, max=2147483647

or with bang command, 
!ApplicationMonitor (name) (application) [update frequency]


Each application monitor will maintain the following Evars:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(name)IsRunning
- true if the application is running, false if it is not running.


Each application monitor has the following events:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(name)OnEnd
- Fires when the monitored application ends (there are no more instances of it
  running)
  
(name)OnStart
- Fires when the monitored application starts
